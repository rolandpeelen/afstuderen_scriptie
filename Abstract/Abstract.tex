\chapter*{Abstract}%

As a company that specialises in high-end photorealistic imagery, Peppr is always on the lookout for new technologies. As was the case with their product configurators. They built one using then state-of-the-art technology but wanted something better. In their own research they found WebGL and wanted to know whether or not it would be a viable alternative to pre-rendering all options of the configurator. \newline
After starting out dissecting the workflow Peppr used to build their configurator, research objective could be set. Both in development and user experience there were key-points that would determine either the success or failure of the technology. From their current workflow, the rendering and automating was something that made every single project difficult. This was a point that most definitely needed research. The differences in workflow and accompanying costs would be others.\newline
The next step was to look at another perspective, that from the user. The User Experience is an important part of a configurator as it partly determines wether users will continue using the configurator to eventually buy something or end up confused or annoyed and leave the configurator with a bad feeling. Three things were tested in this thesis: The amount of MegaBytes the user needs to download to use the configurator, how quickly that loads and how the WebGL configurator performs on speed tests and lastly, if the WebGL technology is compatible with the current browser technology. \newline
With these objectives in mind, finding literature or previous research at this intersection of cutting edge technology and user experience proved extremely difficult. This resulted in building a prototype of a WebGL configurator. The prototype featured an AngularJS with ThreeJS front-end that loads its data from a JSON style Angular constant. With the prototype in place, testing commenced. \newline
Looking at the research objectives that came from the development cycle, there was a clear victor. A saving of 8.6\% in the creation of the application was just the beginning. In their current workflow, adding a component would add an estimate of 5 hours, while the WebGL version would take just 15 minutes. When adding an extra component, the change is even bigger. In their current workflow, it would take roughly 27 hours, while WebGL version would take just 1 hour and 40 minutes. \newline
Some interesting results were found from the UX perspective too. Firstly, that while the 3d models are relatively big, the page loads are actually less than the previous configurator Peppr built. This was partly due to the fact that Peppr chose to preload all images for one configuration in their current workflow and partly due to the fact images were used and they can only be compressed so much before losing quality. Secondly, the application was quite fast and responsive, rendering at an average 19fps on a two year old iPhone 6. Lastly, the application rendered and was usable on 12 of the latest devices and browsers. \newline
All-in-all, there is no other conclusion to be made that the technology is definitely ripe for production. While the implementation will require a slightly different workflow focussing more on software, the savings and added flexibility should outweigh that inconvenience.

\section{Abstract}

Peppr is a company that specializes itself in building photo-realistic visualizations. Last year, Peppr was asked to build a product configurator for a company that makes bespoke tailor made shirts so their customers would be able to design their own shirts with custom colors, sleeves, buttons etc. 

The current way of building said configurator, is to split up the product into different layers that resemble the options and create images for every configuration. In Peppr's case, there where 25 colors, 2 perspectives, 7 collars, 6 sleeves and 3 base shirts. This left Peppr with a sum of 6300 different images that had to be made, and if the client wanted to add another color, they would have to build another set of 252 images. This is a very timely and costly venture.

Thus, Peppr concluded the usual way of doing these types of projects is suboptimal, and started looking for an alternative, which is where this project comes to play. March 2011 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) was the first release of WebGL, an online OpenGL rendering system that directly renders to a computers hardware.

\section{Development}
Developing a product configurator is by any means no easy feat. Building it using 3d technology may be even harder. The following three questions should be answered in this thesis.
â€‹\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the cost differences for development?
% Estimate time for both projects
% Find 3d pricing
% Find developer pricing for CMS
% Find developer pricing for custom
% Check server costs
% Check CMS average upgrade cyclus
% Check NPM package average upgrade cyclus
% Check main NPM package upgrade cyclus
% Initial, Server costs, Upgrade costs

\item How flexible is the end result compared to previous generation configurators
% Estimate time in old way
% Find 3 different product configurators
% See how far we get re-building them using the CMS
% Estimate time in new way

\item How easy is it so maintain the application compared to existing configurators?
% Interview Frederick with regards to maintaining the application / costs (what is it like owning a setup like that)
% --> from "What is the cost difference for development?"
% Use CMS average upgrade cyclus
% Use NPM package average upgrade cyclus
% Use main NPM package upgrade cyclus

\item How easy is it to add new options to the configurator compared to the existing configurators?
% Estimate time in old way
% Add new options to configurator
% Estimate time in new way

\end{enumerate}

%   User Experience

\section{User Experience}
Apart from the development cycle, the user experience is a huge part of whether using these types of configurators is viable or not. Even if the development is way cheaper, if users cannot use the application, problems will arise and the old method may prove to be a better option.\begin{enumerate}
\item Is the technology compatible with the users browsing preferences?
% Scan 'caniuse.com' for theoretical problems
% Setup domain with browserify and see how it renders

\item Is the technology small enough?
% Record network activity for three other product configurators that have a comparable setup
% Record network activity for OpenGL version
% Find average site size
% Find psychology behind it

\item Is the technology quick enough?
% Old -- Record / time switching between 'models'
% Old -- Record / time switching between 'materials'
% New -- Record / time switching between 'models'
% New -- Record / time switching between 'materials'
% Use data from bandwidth to calculate average loading time per network type (2g, 3g, 4g, etc.)

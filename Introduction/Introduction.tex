\chapter{Introduction}

Peppr is a company that is specialised in building visualisations and animations. They were founded in 2007 and from the start, focussed on creating high-end, photorealistic imagery. They try to stay up-to-date with new technologies and are always up for a challenge. The company consists of 4 people that bind themselves using a partnership agreement.

In 2014, Peppr was asked to build a product configurator for one of their customers (SlimFitted, a company that makes tailored shirts). They wanted a platform on which their customers would be able to order customised shirts. The customer requested the configurator accommodated for 25 colors, 2 perspectives, 7 types of collars, 6 types of sleeves and 3 different plaids. The amount of possible shirt combinations was a staggering 3.150 (25 * 7 * 6 * 3) and all of those had to be rendered from two perspectives. Creating the set of images that would make this a possibility was massive. Smartly dividing the images into parts and only changing the requested image would make things a bit easier, but the overall image-set would still be huge.

Apart from the actual images needed, the end-user needs to be able to view and edit a configuration in a simple way. This means a piece of software had to be built to show the configuration to the user. In an ideal scenario, Peppr builds a piece of software that can be re-used. Unfortunately, every customer will need their own branding and every configurator may have slightly different controls. Adding to that difficulty is the image-set. It was huge to begin with, so Peppr slit it up into several parts. This meant they could change the collar while retaining the rest of the image. This was a tricky process and adding the complexity to make it re-usable would have been a massive undertaking in both time, money, resulting in a configurator that is more complex and prone to bugs.

Peppr feels there must be a better way to serve their customers in the future, so they will end up with a cheaper, more maintainable configurator. Current technologies allow the viewing of 3d models directly in the browser. In 2015, Peppr got a second request to build a configurator and started researching their possibilities. When they did, they stumbled upon a piece of technology called OpenGL (/ WebGL) and a javascript based binding to use it on the web called "three.js". This type of technology means that a 3d model can be shown directly in browser (hardware accelerated) instead of pre-rendered images. It may well be the next big thing when it comes to configurators.

A second clients order fell through, but Peppr felt the need to explore the possibilities of WebGL further nonetheless. To put it in concrete words; Is a WebGL product configurator that directly shows 3d models instead of images a viable alternative to their current workflow? Both in development, as in end user experience.

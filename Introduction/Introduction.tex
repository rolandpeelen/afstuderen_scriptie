\chapter{Introduction}

Peppr is a company that is specialised in building visualisations and animations. The company was founded in 2007 and from the start their focus was on creating high-end, photorealistic imagery. They try to stay up-to-date with new technologies and are always up for a challenge. The company consists of 4 people that bind themselves using a partnership agreement.

In 2014, Peppr was asked to build a product configurator for one of their customers (SlimFitted, a company that makes tailored shirts). They wanted a platform on which their customers would be able to order tailor made shirts. The customer's request was for a configurator that would have options for 25 colors, 2 perspectives, 7 types of collars, 6 types of sleeves and 3 different plaids. The amount of possible shirt combinations was a staggering 3.150 (25 * 7 * 6 * 3) and all of those had to be rendered from two perspectives (so 6.300 imagers). Creating the set of images that would make this a possibility was massive. Smartly dividing the images into parts and only changing the requested image would make things a bit easier. This meant, for example, that they could change the collar without changing the rest of the image. This was a tricky process and added a lot of complexity.

Apart from the actual images needed, the end-user needs to be able to view and edit a configuration in a simple way. This means a piece of software had to be built to show the configuration to the user. In an ideal scenario, Peppr builds a piece of software that can be re-used. Unfortunately, every customer will need their own branding and every configurator may have slightly different controls. Combined with the rigidity of the image set used, a re-usable configurator was out of the question.

Peppr feels there must be a better way to serve their customers in the future, offering their customers a cheaper, more maintainable configurator. Current technologies allow the viewing of 3d models directly in the browser. In 2015, Peppr got a second request to build a configurator and started researching the possibilities. When they did, they encountered a piece of technology called WebGL (a web-base Application Programming Interface (api) for OpenGL) and a javascript based API to use it on the web called "three.js". This type of technology makes for a 3d model that can be shown directly in a webbrowser (hardware accelerated) instead of pre-rendered images. It may well be the next big thing when it comes to configurators.

The second customer backed out, but Peppr felt the need to explore the possibilities of WebGL nonetheless. To put it in concrete words: Is a WebGL product configurator that directly shows 3d models instead of images a viable alternative to their current workflow? Both in development, as well as end user experience.
